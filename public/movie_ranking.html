<h1>My fave movies</h1>
<p>This is a list of my top 3 movies</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Spirited Away</h2>
<p>There is something very liberating about this movie.<br/>
The fantasy creatures and scenery and new way of life allow <br>
you to really disconnect and enjoy the adventure.
</p>

<h2>Romulus</h2>
<p>
    I'm a complete sci-fi nerd and it does not really get <br>
    better than this. There is new tech and dystopia galor, <br>
    great way for you to fantasize about the future and potential <br>
    of humanity.
</p>

<h2>Catch me if you can</h2>
<p>
    A feel good movie about a criminal turned nice guy. Leonardo <br>
    raises himself out of poverty by way of forgery and is caught <br>
    by a relentless cop. Friendship ensues and leaves you feeling <br>
    like behind every bad turn is an opportunity for redemption.
